# Webhook 

## Configuration

Control the behavior of the webhook by adding query parameters to the webhook url

- `less_feedback=True`: This only provides feedback on more serious issues in the code. This can significantly reduce suggestions related to issues such as inappropriate variable names, lack of documentation, and lack of exception handling.

## How to use

1. How to configure the webhook:

- Github
    1. event.action == "opened"
    2. event.contains(pull_request)
    3. event.pull_request.state == "open"
    4. event.pull_request.draft == False
- Gitlab
    1. event.object_kind == "merge_request"
    2. event.contains(object_attributes)
    3. event.object_attributes.action in ("open", "reopen")
    4. event.object_attributes.state == "opened"
    5. event.object_attributes.work_in_progress == False

2. How to manually ignore a PR:

Add `@codedog.pull.ignore` in the PR's title
