# Getting Started

## What is Codedog

Codedog is an AI powered code review assistant. It watches PR event in your repository and make a Code Review instantly after anyone created a PR.

Codedog aim to help reduce the time spent on code review and improve the quality of code review for your team.

This guide will show you how to use our Github App for your repository / organization and get your first code review.


## Github App

### Installation

Install our app [Codedog Assistant](https://github.com/apps/codedog-assistant) in your Github project.

### Get your first code review

Create a mergable and non-draft pull request in your repository to see the assistant comment on the PR.

### Usage limitation

Github App has a 10 PR / month limitation. If you reach the limitation and want more, you can contact us
in Discord for a higher limitation.

## Use codedog with Gitlab

Currently we only support gitlab with webhook trigger. Setup a webhook with:
```
https://api.codedog.ai/gitlab_event?gitlab_base_url=your_gitlab_base_url
```

Add your Gitlab base url, like "https://git.private-repository.com" to the query string.

Then you also need add a parameter `gitlab_token` to the request header. Which must have authority to read data and comment merge request in this repository. Which is at least `reporter`.

## Self Hosted

Codedog core langchain application is open sourced and avaiable on [Github](https://github.com/codedog-ai/codedog)

You can deploy your own PR review service with it.

Check the [examples](https://github.com/codedog-ai/codedog/tree/master/examples)
