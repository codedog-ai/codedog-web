# Getting Started

## What is Codedog

Codedog is an AI powered code review assistant. Codedog helps you and your team automate the generation of merge request summaries and reviews.

## Installation

### Github

Click to install the [Codedog Assistant](https://github.com/apps/codedog-assistant) in your Github project.

### Gitlab

1. Due to the private nature of the Gitlab platform, you need to create an account for commenting and apply for a PAC (Personal Access Token) for this account.

2. Add this account to the project that requires MR (Merge Request) review, and grant this account `Reporter` level permissions.

3. Add the Codedog's Webhook to this project, where the `url` is your Gitlab URL, and the `token` is the PAC you just applied for. Please note that the `url` should include the protocol prefix `http://` or `https://`.

::code-group

```plain [webhook]
https://api.codedog.ai/v1/webhook/gitlab?url={url}&token={token}
```

::

Set the Webhook to be triggered by the `Merge Request` event.

## Verification

Create a new Pull Request, and Codedog will analyze it within 2 minutes and leave comments in the PR. If you do not receive a comment from Codedog within 2 minutes, please try to close and reopen the current PR.

## More Information
