# Why We Build Codedog

In the software development process, the primary goal of code review is to ensure the stability and improvement of the overall quality of the codebase. However, to achieve this goal, we have a series of constraints tha

- Almost all development teams face time pressures to complete tasks on time. The cost of a decline in codebase quality is hidden and long-term, while the pressure to complete objectives is explicit and real-time. Therefore, development teams may reduce their investment in design and testing, leading to a gradual decline in code quality.

- Effective code review requires a high level of competency from the reviewers. They often need to have rich experience and knowledge in both the team's technology stack and business scenarios. The time of these reviewers is very scarce. As the business expands, the amount of code to be reviewed grows exponentially, as does the amount of code review.

The above are the reasons why Codedog hopes to introduce AI into the code review scene. With the assistance of AI, we can achieve a better balance between **on-time delivery**, **human resource cost**, and **code quality**.

Specifically, Codedog is currently exploring two directions:

1. Have AI generate preliminary code change assessment reports to assist reviewers in conducting code reviews. This helps them understand code faster, find problems, and thereby increase their efficiency.

2. Have AI independently conduct code reviews, find some simple issues, and provide improvement suggestions to reduce the workload of the reviewers.

## The Value of Code Review

AI has broad application prospects in the development process. The reason why we chose the code review scene is for three reasons:

1. This is a scenario with clear boundaries and clear value.

2. This is a scenario that mainly depends on high-value manpower, and the degree of automation is very low. Therefore, the benefits of increasing its degree of automation are high.

3. This is a scenario that requires technical + business understanding and context, so we believe that the capabilities required to do a good job of code review can be well migrated to the ultimate scenario of AI autonomous development in the future.
